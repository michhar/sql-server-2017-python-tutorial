# Getting Started

## Setup

You'll need SQL Server 2017 first.  Get the Community Technology Preview (CTP) using your MSDN Subscription or by downloading from Microsoft [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-2017).

Follow the installation instructions at [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/advanced-analytics/python/setup-python-machine-learning-services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/advanced-analytics/python/setup-python-machine-learning-services).  It is recommended to select **Developer** as the free edition during installation and call the instance something informative like SQLSERVER2017 in case you have other versions of SQL Server on your system.  Also, right before the actual installation take note of the location of the config file that looks like:

    C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\140\Setup Bootstrap\Log\20170619_161507\ConfigurationFile.ini
